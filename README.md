## How To Use:
- Download latest release file, or "release" folder from the repository.
- Extract the .zip file, edit "default.py" and modify the "collections =" section to point to the Internet Archive collection of your choice! Just make a copy of the line below and modify it as needed.
- Copy the "Medusa" folder to Q:/plugins/video
- Run the add-on and enjoy!

## Issues:
- You tell me.

## TODO:
- Improve media streaming a bit.
- Implement better filename sanitization
- Implement some sort of login system so access-locked files can be downloaded.

## Disclaimer:
- The Internet Archive is a vast archive of many files, tons of which are legal to download! Make sure you follow the copyright laws of your region while downloading from Internet Archive sources. Support will not be given for anyone trying to use this utility for blatant piracy.
